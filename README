16 Sep 2018 Linus Torvalds sent a message to the LKML which contains
(among other things) phrases like:

    "The fact that I then misread people and don't realize (for years)
    how badly I've judged a situation and contributed to an
    unprofessional environment is not good."

    "I know now this was not OK and I am truly sorry."

    "I am going to take time off and get some assistance on how to
    understand people's emotions and respond appropriately."

This is not the way we like Linus to talk to people. Quite frankly,
that sucks. Of course, no matter what, Linus *IS* Linus, but in case
he changes his behavior we need to be prepared.

`hooked_on_linus.sh` is a script that will throw some useful
observations about the code you try to commit. Just run it in your Git
directory. Use `-c` option to check a specific directory. You can
install it as a pre-commit hook via `hooked_on_linus.sh -i <git_dir>`
(if you are not smart enough to do it manually).
