16 Sep 2018 Linus Torvalds sent a message to the LKML which
contains (among other things) phrases like:

    "The fact that I then misread people and don't realize (for
     years) how badly I've judged a situation and contributed
     to an unprofessional environment is not good."

    "I know now this was not OK and I am truly sorry."

    "I am going to take time off and get some assistance on how
     to understand people’s emotions and respond appropriately."

This is not the way we like Linus to talk to people. Quite
frankly, that sucks. Of course, no matter what, Linus *IS*
Linus, but in case if he change his behaviour we need to be
prepared.

`hooked_on_linus.sh` is a script that will throw some useful
observations about the code you try to commit. Just run it in your
Git directory. You can install it as pre-commit hook via
`hooked_on_linus.sh -i .` (if you are not smart enough to do it
manually).
